#Resources that live in a zone are referred to as zonal resources. Virtual machine instances and persistent disks live in a zone. If you want to attach a persistent disk to a virtual machine instance, both resources must be in the same zone. Similarly, if you want to assign a static IP address to an instance, the instance must be in the same region as the static IP address

#Identify your default region and zone

#In the Google Cloud Console, on the Dashboard, under Project info. (Click Navigation menu, and then click Home > Dashboard. Copy your project ID to your clipboard or text editor.



#In Cloud Shell, run the following gcloud command, replacing <your_project_ID> with the project ID you copied

gcloud compute project-info describe --project <your_project_ID>


#If the google-compute-default-region and google-compute-default-zone keys and values are missing from the output, no default zone or region is set.




#Environment variables define your environment and help save time when you write scripts that contain APIs or executables

#Create an environment variable to store your Project ID, replacing <your_project_ID> with the value for name from the gcloud compute project-info describe command you ran earlier

export PROJECT_ID=<your_project_ID>


#Create an environment variable to store your Zone, replacing <your_zone> with the value for zone from the gcloud compute project-info describe command you ran earlier

export ZONE=<your_zone>

#To verify that your variables were set properly, run the following commands

echo $PROJECT_ID
echo $ZONE

#The gcloud tool offers simple usage guidelines that are available by adding the -h flag (for help) onto the end of any gcloud command

#Run any of the three following commands (for help); You can access more verbose help by appending the --help flag onto a command or running the gcloud help command.
